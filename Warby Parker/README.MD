                                  Marketing Funnel Analysis

Key Insights:
- The largest drop-off occurs between questions 3 and 4, with a 19.0% decrease in responses.
- The second-largest drop-off occurs between questions 4 and 5, with an 18.2% decrease in responses.
- The overall completion rate for the quiz is 54.0%, indicating a significant loss of users throughout the funnel.

Recommendations:
- Optimize questions 3 and 4 to improve user engagement and reduce drop-off.
- Consider removing or rephrasing question 5, as it may be causing users to abandon the quiz.
- Analyze user feedback and behavior to identify additional areas for improvement.

                                  Customer Count by Stage
Key Insights:
- The largest drop-off occurs between the Quiz and Home Try-On stages, with a loss of 250 customers (25%).
- The second-largest drop-off occurs between the Home Try-On and Purchase stages, with a loss of 255 customers (34%).

Recommendations:
- Optimize the Home Try-On experience to reduce drop-off and increase conversion to Purchase.
- Analyze user feedback and behavior to identify areas for improvement in the Quiz and Home Try-On stages.
- Consider implementing strategies to re-engage customers who drop off at each stage.

                                    Conversion Rates

Key Insights:
- The highest conversion rate is from Quiz to Home Try-On, indicating a strong interest in trying on products after completing the quiz.
- The conversion rate from Home Try-On to Purchase is lower, suggesting that some users may not be satisfied with the try-on experience or may need more encouragement to make a purchase.
- The overall conversion rate from Quiz to Purchase is 49.5%, indicating that about half of users who start the quiz ultimately make a purchase.

Recommendations:
- Continue to optimize the quiz and Home Try-On experience to ensure a seamless and engaging user journey.
- Analyze user feedback and behavior to identify areas for improvement in the Purchase stage.
- Consider implementing strategies to re-engage users who drop off at each stage and encourage them to complete their purchase.

                                      A/B Test Results
Key Insights:
- The 5-pairs group has a significantly higher conversion rate (79.24%) compared to the 3-pairs group (53.03%).
- The 5-pairs group also has higher total revenue ($33,030) and total units sold (294) compared to the 3-pairs group.
- The average price point is similar between the two groups, indicating that the increased conversion rate is not due to a difference in pricing.

Recommendations:
- Offer 5 pairs as the default option for Home Try-On to maximize conversion rates and revenue.
- Continue to monitor user behavior and feedback to identify areas for further optimization.
- Consider testing additional variations, such as 7 pairs or a "build your own" option, to further improve conversion rates.
